        <p>
          There's research on data sovereignty. Research on shame in language learning. Research on AI and Indigenous communities. Nobody has woven them together to ask: <strong class="text-whenua">what happens when AI holds a conversation that touches something sacred?</strong>

          <p>Lian and Lee go way back. They first crossed paths when Lian was four or five — Lee went to school with her older sister. Fast forward twenty years and they found each other again as Learning Designers, battling it out for top spot at eLearning conference competitions year after year. That rivalry turned into a partnership when they worked together at Northpower for three to four years in the People and Capability team, and stood alongside each other as Kaitiaki in the peer support network.</p>
          <p>Now they are doing their master's side by side — and the research landed in the same space. The people using Lee's app are scared — scared of making mistakes, of being judged, of not being Māori enough. The people using Lian's app are scared too — scared of being vulnerable, of opening up to a machine. The emotional terrain is the same. The cultural questions are the same. They are stronger exploring them together.</p>

      <Accordion title="Our tools and their limitations">
        <div class="py-4 space-y-4">
          <p>We believe in being upfront about our tools and their limitations. This research uses:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-5 space-y-1 text-whenua/70">
            <li>ElevenLabs (US-based) for the conversational AI voice agent</li>
            <li>Supabase (hosted in Sydney, Australia) for registration data, with row-level security</li>
            <li>Zoom for the live wānanga</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not own or control the AI infrastructure. The voice platform is built by a company based outside Aotearoa, governed by US law, with data stored on US servers. We have opted out of our data being used for AI model training, but ElevenLabs' Terms of Service include a broad license on data processed through their platform.</p>
          <p>We chose these tools because building our own voice AI infrastructure was beyond our resources as two master's students working across Aotearoa. Te Hiku Media — who built their own speech recognition for te reo Māori — have shown what full sovereignty looks like. We are not there. We are honest about that, and the tension between our principles and our tools is part of what this research examines.</p>
