            <p>
              The research started with feedback systems — the surveys, review platforms, and forms that businesses use to hear from their customers. What became clear early on was that the problem isn't verification or technology. The problem is relationality. Current digital systems are transactional by design. They extract information without building trust, and the people most affected by poor services — Māori, Pasifika, disabled, and digitally excluded communities — are the ones least likely to engage with them.
            </p>
            <p>
              Project Rise explores how conversational AI can transform these transactional interactions into relational, trust-building experiences. The research is grounded in three core values drawn from Māori and Pasifika worldviews:

            <div class="space-y-4 text-base md:text-lg text-whenua/80 leading-relaxed">
              <p>Ray didn't start as a research project. It started at home.</p>
              <p>Lian built a conversational AI agent for herself and her husband — a tool to help them talk through the stuff that's hard to talk through. Patterns they kept falling into. Conversations that went sideways. The things you know you need to say but can't quite find the words for.</p>
              <p>It worked. Not perfectly, not like therapy, but enough that something shifted. They were hearing each other differently. And Lian found herself at an intersection she hadn't expected — sitting with a tool she'd built in her living room, realising it had just held a genuinely vulnerable conversation, and wondering: could this be used safely by other people? What would it take to do this ethically? And what happens when AI enters spaces that are this personal?</p>
              <p>That's how a homemade app became a case study for a master's thesis.</p>
              <p>Ray is now a voice-based AI relationship coach — the primary case study for Project Rise. Relationships sit at the intersection of identity, emotion, whānau, mana, and trust. They are among the most vulnerable conversations a person can have. The logic is simple: if conversational AI can be designed to work ethically and safely in this context, it can work anywhere.</p>
              <p>Ray works with any relationship — romantic, whānau, friendships, workplace, or your relationship with yourself. It helps people recognise patterns, see dynamics they might be stuck in, and make decisions with more clarity. It is coaching, not therapy. It is transparent about being AI. And it is built on the same values that underpin all of Project Rise.</p>
              <p>Ray is currently in a two-week pilot (February 12–26, 2026) with participants testing whether the approach delivers on its promises: safety, cultural grounding, and genuine usefulness in vulnerable conversations.</p>

            <p class="text-base md:text-lg text-whenua/80 leading-relaxed">Most AI is designed for efficiency. Project Rise asks whether AI can be designed for care. The research contributes a framework that does not yet exist — one that centres Indigenous values in conversational AI design, not as decoration but as architecture. If the pilot shows that Ray is safe, helpful, and culturally grounded, the principles behind it become a blueprint for any conversational AI operating in vulnerable spaces.</p>

              Mana Ako sits within Lee's Master's research programme exploring conversational AI in Indigenous language revitalisation. This is not about proving that AI works. It is about asking whether it should, how it might, and where the limits sit.

              Many adult learners describe hesitation, whakamā, or anxiety about speaking out loud. Mana Ako explores whether practising privately with an AI kōrero partner might support confidence, or whether it risks creating something unintended. This research remains open to both possibilities.

Fast forward twenty years and they found each other again as Learning Designers, battling it out for top spot at eLearning conference competitions year after year. That rivalry turned into a partnership when they worked together at Northpower for three to four years in the People and Capability team, and stood alongside each other as Kaitiaki in the peer support network.</p>
            <p>Now they are doing their master's side by side — and the research landed in the same space. The people using Lee's app are scared — scared of making mistakes, of being judged, of not being Māori enough. The people using Lian's app are scared too — scared of being vulnerable, of opening up to a machine. The emotional terrain is the same. The cultural questions are the same. They are stronger exploring them together.</p>
