      <p>
        We are Lian and Lee. We are completing our Master of Technological Futures and we have both built conversational AI that people use in moments of vulnerability — when they are scared to speak te reo, or scared to open up about their relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have learned a lot. But the deeper we go, the bigger the questions get.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does safety actually feel like when conversational AI holds a vulnerable conversation? Where are the cultural boundaries that technology should not cross? And who gets to decide?
      </p>
      <p>
        We cannot figure this out from research papers. We need people — people who carry lived experience, cultural knowledge, and honest instincts about what feels right and what does not.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is why we are inviting you to participate in a kōrero — on your terms — followed by an online wānanga where we explore these questions together.

                There is research on data sovereignty. There is research on shame and safety in language learning. There is research on AI and Indigenous communities. But nobody has woven those together to ask:
            </p>

                What happens when conversational AI holds a conversation that touches something sacred or vulnerable? What cultural obligations arise? And how do we design for that?
            </p>
            <p>
                That is the gap — and your whakaaro helps fill it.

            <h4 class="font-bold text-whenua text-lg md:text-xl mt-8 md:mt-10 mb-2">What you will do</h4>
            <p>
                Have a kōrero — either with the AI (about 10–15 minutes using Lian's voice), with a person (about 30 minutes with Lian or Lee), or both. It will explore safety, vulnerability, and what feels right when conversational AI is involved in culturally significant spaces. It is not a test. There are no wrong answers. It is a kōrero.
            </p>
            <p>
                Then, join us for a 90-minute online wānanga on <strong>Thursday 26 February, 6.30pm to 8pm NZDT</strong>, where we go deeper — together.
            </p>
            <p>
                The wānanga is designed as a culturally grounded space to reflect on your experience. If you have the AI conversation in the same week, you will be able to sit with it while it is still fresh and explore what it brought up alongside others who have been through the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the end of the wānanga, you will have the option to share any final reflections.
            </p>

            <h4 class="font-bold text-whenua text-lg md:text-xl mt-8 md:mt-10 mb-2">What you will need</h4>
            <p>
                A quiet space, a device with a microphone, and about 15 minutes for the AI conversation (or 30 minutes for a person-to-person kōrero). The wānanga will be on Zoom.

          If we could get everyone in one room, we would. Kanohi ki te kanohi is always the first choice for this kind of mahi. But our participants are spread right across Aotearoa — from Tai Tokerau to Ōtautahi and everywhere in between — and two master's students do not come with a travel budget (if you know someone who wants to fund us, send them our way).
        </p>
        <p>
          So we are doing what we can with what we have. We are building with the tools and skills available to us, and being as transparent and authentic as possible about what those tools can and cannot do. What we lack in resources we are making up for in care and honesty.
        </p>
        <p>
          If this work grows beyond our theses — and we hope it does — the aspiration is always to be together in person. For now, this is where we start.

          <p>Founder of DreamStorm, mum of five (including triplets), based in Whangārei. Samoan and NZ European. After 14 years in learning design, coaching, and organisational wellbeing, Lian kept seeing the same thing — people are not the problem, systems are. So she taught herself to build. Her master's project — Project Rise — explores how relational conversational AI can serve Māori, Pasifika, disabled, and digitally excluded communities, with one non-negotiable: build tech that serves people rather than extracts from them.</p>

Lee brings a designer's eye and a South Auckland sense of humour to everything she builds. Her master's project explores how conversational AI can support te reo Māori learners by providing a personalised, culturally grounded, and emotionally safe learning experience — creating space for people to practise te reo without the fear and shame that often accompanies learning in front of others.</p>

          <p>Lian and Lee go way back. They first crossed paths when Lian was four or five — Lee went to school with her older sister. Fast forward twenty years and they found each other again as Learning Designers, battling it out for top spot at eLearning conference competitions year after year. That rivalry turned into a partnership when they worked together at Northpower for three to four years in the People and Capability team, and stood alongside each other as Kaitiaki in the peer support network.</p>
          <p>Now they are doing their master's side by side — and the research landed in the same space. The people using Lee's app are scared — scared of making mistakes, of being judged, of not being Māori enough. The people using Lian's app are scared too — scared of being vulnerable, of opening up to a machine. The emotional terrain is the same. The cultural questions are the same. They are stronger exploring them together.</p>

          <p>We believe in being upfront about our tools and their limitations. This research uses:</p>

            <li>ElevenLabs (US-based) for the conversational AI voice agent</li>

            <li>Zoom for the live wānanga</li>
          </ul>
          <p>We do not own or control the AI infrastructure. The voice platform is built by a company based outside Aotearoa, governed by US law, with data stored on US servers. We have opted out of our data being used for AI model training, but ElevenLabs' Terms of Service include a broad license on data processed through their platform.</p>
          <p>We chose these tools because building our own voice AI infrastructure was beyond our resources as two master's students working across Aotearoa. Te Hiku Media — who built their own speech recognition for te reo Māori — have shown what full sovereignty looks like. We are not there. We are honest about that, and the tension between our principles and our tools is part of what this research examines.</p>
