      <!-- Two Layers of Control -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-whenua mb-4">Two Layers of Data Control</h2>
        <p class="mb-4">There are two separate systems handling your data, each with different controls.</p>

        <div class="bg-white/60 p-6 rounded-lg border border-kakahu/20 mb-4">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-whenua text-lg mb-2">Layer A: The Research (Lian and Lee)</h3>
          <p>We control how your conversation content is used for research purposes — what gets analysed, how it is stored in Supabase, and how findings are shared. Your registration details and the transcripts we download for analysis are stored in Supabase (hosted in Sydney, Australia, AWS ap-southeast-2) with Row-Level Security ensuring your data is isolated and protected. You can ask us to delete your research data at any time.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="bg-white/60 p-6 rounded-lg border border-kakahu/20">
          <h3 class="font-bold text-whenua text-lg mb-2">Layer B: The Technology (ElevenLabs)</h3>
          <p>ElevenLabs (USA) processes the voice conversation. When you speak to the AI agent, your voice and words are sent to their servers in the United States. By using the AI agent, your data is subject to their <a href="https://elevenlabs.io/terms-of-use" target="_blank" rel="noopener" class="text-ako underline">Terms of Service</a>, which grants them a broad, perpetual license to use conversation data to provide and improve their services.</p>
          <p class="mt-3">We have opted out of ElevenLabs using your data for AI model training. However, we cannot revoke their standard processing license. ElevenLabs also reserves the right to moderate conversations for safety purposes, which means their staff or contractors may access your conversation content.</p>

          <li>ElevenLabs retains voice data for up to 3 years after last interaction — we cannot control their retention or use of data already processed through their platform.</li>

          <li>Participation is completely voluntary — and consent is ongoing, not a one-time decision.</li>
          <li>You can stop the conversation at any time — just close the browser.</li>
          <li>You can switch from the AI to a person, or from a person to the AI, at any point.</li>
          <li>You can withdraw your data from our research database up to two weeks after the wānanga by emailing us.</li>
          <li>You can participate in the AI conversation without attending the wānanga, or vice versa.</li>
          <li>You must be 18 or older to use the AI agent.</li>
          <li>If you are under 18 or prefer not to use AI, you can <a href="/human" class="text-ako underline">book a conversation with us directly</a>.</li>
          <li>Choosing not to participate has no consequences whatsoever.</li>
        </ul>

      <!-- Who sees your data -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-whenua mb-4">Who will see your responses</h2>
        <p>
          Lian and Lee (the researchers), and our academic supervisors (Felix Scholz and Paula Gair). Cultural advisors may review de-identified themes. Your name will not appear in any published work unless you specifically request attribution.

      <!-- Why we are being this direct -->
      <div>
        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-whenua mb-4">Why we are being this direct</h2>
        <p>
          We are researching data sovereignty while using a platform we do not control, hosted in a country with different privacy laws than Aotearoa. The terms of that platform do not align with the Indigenous data sovereignty principles our research is built on. We chose it because building our own voice AI was beyond our capacity, and we believe this research needs to happen now rather than waiting for perfect infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p class="mt-3">
          You deserve to know exactly what you are agreeing to. This contradiction is real, and it is one of the things we are exploring in this research. What we lack in resources, we are making up for in honesty.
