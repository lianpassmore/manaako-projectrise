          Not everyone wants to talk to an AI, and that is completely fine — it is actually useful data for our research to know that too. There is no preferred option. Every path contributes equally.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can book a 30-minute conversation with Lian or Lee instead. We will cover the same territory as the AI conversation, just human to human.
        </p>
        <p>
          This option is also available for anyone under 18 who wants to participate.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you have already had a kōrero with a person and want to try the AI conversation as well, you are welcome to do that too.
